Below are the currently available examples:

**Examples:**

- **Fe<sub>3</sub>Pt**: Example of applying zentropy to the 3 lowest energy configurations in Fe<sub>3</sub>Pt 12-atom supercell. The Helmholtz energies were calculated using the energy–volume curves and the Debye–Grüneisen model.

The Jupyter notebooks are located in `examples/codespace` and can be run using **GitHub Codespaces** or locally in your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code).
